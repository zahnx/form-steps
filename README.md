# Form Steps - Children Props

## Description
This simple project is to showcase the proper use of children props to create a reusable component in React.js

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- React

## Notes
- The children prop allow us **to pass JSX into an element** (besides regular props)
- Essential tool to make **reusable** and **configurable** components (especially component content)
- Really useful for **generic** components that **don't know their content** before being used (e.g modal)
